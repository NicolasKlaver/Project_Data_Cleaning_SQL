# Project_Data_Cleaning_SQL

# SQL_Project: Nashville Housing Data Cleaning 
In this project I make a Data Exploration Analysis of the Covid 19 dataset where we look correlations to create tables and visualize the results in Tableau in a future project.


#### Skills used: 
- Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types.


#### Data:
- url: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths


#### Files
- data_exploration.sql: contains all the first steps to understand the data.


## Examples of some Queries

##### First Query:
-  We see the maximum cases that occurred in a Location and the percentage that it represents in its Population.
